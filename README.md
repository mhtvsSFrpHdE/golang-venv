# golang-venv

This is a joke, but is does the job.  
So if anyone are really doing the real golang virtual environment and wish to take the repository name,  
see https://github.com/mhtvsSFrpHdE/contact-me and I will do the transfer.

## What's this

For those don't wish to put the entire world into `GOPATH`.

## How to use

1. Create a new folder
1. Download bat files and put into new folder
1. Run `venv.bat`, this copy current `GOPATH` to a new folder under step.1
1. Edit `editor.bat`, this is what to do after `activate.bat`, for example text editor
1. Run `activate.bat`
1. `GOPATH` will redirect to this local one, then text editor runs.
